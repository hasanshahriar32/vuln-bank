# Vulnerable Bank Application üè¶

A deliberately vulnerable web application for practicing application security testing, secure code review and implementing security in CI/CD pipelines.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This application is intentionally vulnerable and should only be used for educational purposes in isolated environments.**

## Overview

This project is a simple banking application with multiple security vulnerabilities built in. It's designed to help security engineers, developers, interns, QA analyst and DevSecOps practitioners learn about:
- Common web application vulnerabilities
- Security testing automation
- Secure coding practices
- DevSecOps implementation

## Features & Vulnerabilities

### Core Banking Features
- üîê User Authentication & Authorization
- üí∞ Account Balance Management
- üí∏ Money Transfers
- üìù Loan Requests
- üë§ Profile Picture Upload
- üìä Transaction History
- üîë Password Reset System (3-digit PIN)

### Implemented Vulnerabilities

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - SQL Injection in login
   - Weak JWT implementation
   - Broken object level authorization (BOLA)
   - Weak password reset mechanism (3-digit PIN)

2. **Data Security**
   - Information disclosure
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Plaintext password storage
   - SQL injection points

3. **File Operations**
   - Unrestricted file upload
   - Path traversal vulnerabilities
   - No file type validation
   - Directory traversal

4. **Session Management**
   - Token vulnerabilities
   - No session expiration
   - Weak secret keys

## Installation & Setup üöÄ

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commando-X/vuln-bank.git
cd vuln-bank
```

2. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t vuln-bank .
```

3. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 vuln-bank
```

### Option 2: Local Installation (Without Docker)

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Commando-X/vuln-bank.git
cd vuln-bank
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create necessary directories:
```bash
# On Windows
mkdir static\uploads

# On Linux/Mac
mkdir -p static/uploads
```

5. Run the application:
```bash
# On Windows
python app.py

# On Linux/Mac
python3 app.py
```

### Accessing the Application
Once running, access the application at:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Default Credentials
- Admin Account:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Windows
1. If you get "python not found":
   - Ensure Python is added to your system PATH
   - Try using `py` instead of `python`

2. Permission issues with uploads folder:
   - Run command prompt as administrator
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory

#### Linux/Mac
1. Permission denied when creating directories:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p static/uploads
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER static/uploads
   ```

2. Port 5000 already in use:
   ```bash
   # Kill process using port 5000
   sudo lsof -i:5000
   sudo kill <PID>
   ```

## Testing Guide üéØ

### Authentication Testing
1. SQL Injection in login
2. Weak password reset (bruteforce 3-digit PIN)
3. JWT token manipulation
4. Username enumeration

### Authorization Testing
1. Access other users' transaction history via account number
2. Upload malicious files
3. Access admin panel
4. Manipulate JWT claims

### File Upload Testing
1. Upload unauthorized file types
2. Attempt path traversal
3. Upload oversized files
4. Test file overwrite scenarios
